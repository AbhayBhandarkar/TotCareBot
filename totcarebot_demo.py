    **Project Overview**: TotCareBot is an interactive, emotion-detecting system designed for use in play homes. It monitors children's emotions, responds in real-time, and alerts caregivers when necessary.
    
    **Features**:
    - Real-time emotion detection using text input or images.
    - Image-based emotion detection through facial expressions using the FER model.
    - A responsive system that generates custom responses and alerts based on detected emotions.
    - Visualized training metrics (accuracy and loss) to evaluate system performance.

    **1. Text-Based Emotion Detection Model (DistilRoBERTa)**:
    The text emotion detection is powered by a pre-trained transformer model from Hugging Face, specifically the **DistilRoBERTa** model trained on the emotion dataset. This model is capable of detecting emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, and more based on the context of the text.

    **How it works**: 
    - The input text is tokenized and passed through a deep learning model (DistilRoBERTa), which processes the sequence of words and predicts the associated emotion. The model generates a confidence score for each predicted emotion.

    **2. Image-Based Emotion Detection Model (FER - Facial Emotion Recognition)**:
    The image-based emotion detection utilizes the **FER (Facial Expression Recognition)** model, which is capable of detecting emotions from facial expressions in real-time. The FER model recognizes emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, and others.

    **How it works**: 
    - The system uses OpenCV to read the input image and detect faces. Once the face is detected, it is analyzed by the FER model to determine the emotions present based on facial landmarks, expressions, and the intensity of features.

    **Architecture Overview**:
    The system consists of multiple modules:
    - **Input Module**: Accepts both text and image inputs for emotion detection.
    - **Emotion Detection Module**: Uses pre-trained deep learning models for sentiment analysis and facial emotion recognition.
    - **Response and Alert Module**: Generates appropriate responses and sends alerts to the caregiver if necessary.
    - **Visualization Module**: Provides real-time feedback and visual analytics to monitor system performance.
